Site Core
===================


Site core is a extended version of Code igniter 3.0. It was designed to suite the needs of any CI developer who wants a full modulable version of this framework. Although it is almost fully usable in the regular Code igniter 3.0 way, it comes with fully preinstalled [HMVC][9], [Spark][10] and [Composer][11] supports so you don't have to install them yourself. Moreover, it includes a *module manager* (which is **highly** inspired from Spark) to allow creation of clean extendables HMVC modules that can depend on other composer, spark or other HMVC module.
